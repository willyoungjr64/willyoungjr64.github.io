							<p>Eric Johnson was one of our many lawyer clients. We were tasked with converting his website from completely HTML to WordPress, updating existing pages, and creating new pages with completely distinct designs. I was involved in every aspect of the design process, along with making the pages on WordPress.</p>
							<p>The most challenging aspect of this project was ensuring that the pages we brought from his old site still kept the same general layout as that was a specific request. The number of pages was also a challenge because the client wanted a page for every city and county he served for SEO purposes. </p>
