							<p>Modern Office Methods was another large client. We handled their SEO, website maintenance, and we rehauled quite a few of their pages. Because their site was bloated, we went through their plugins and deleted those that were causing the site to slow down and updated others such as Yoast SEO to ensure that the site could load and run as fast as possible.</p>
							<p>I handled the creation of the location pages rehaul project. I was tasked with designing them, implementing the design, and ensuring that the location pages were uniform and loaded swiftly. The most challenging aspect of this project was the number of pages that I had to create while staying somewhat uniform with their designs. It allowed for creativity in a way I hadn't been accustomed to at the time.</p>
