							<p>Union City Oral Surgery was one of my first major projects at Market My Market. I was tasked with coming up with the color scheme based on suggestions by the client, along with page layout and design. I worked on dozens of pages myself while constantly receiving feedback from team members and the client themselves. The hardest part of this project was learning how to manage myself and the other tasks that were given to me.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, the website is different, so the only live link is an archived version. I was also tasked with creating a custom flyer using photoshop and InDesign. I created Facebook ads and a Facebook banner using photoshop. Most of those files were kept on my work computer which I no longer have access to.</p>
